i wanted to use either css grid or flex but found it difficult since i had to give the navigation bar's header a fixed position
i had to give the whole navbar a fixed position
since the navbar was fixed, some of the list elements were not visible. i learned that i have to define the height of a div before giving it an overscroll-y property
i positioned the main-doc using absolute to its parent element (which is not static positioned), page-container
to make the whole div that contains the anchor tags hyperlinked, i had to make the anchor tag a block (element since they are inline elements) 
ALWAYS put the media queries at the bottom of the CSS file
